# AI-Blog-Post-Summarization-with-Hugging-Face-Transformers-Beautiful-Soup-Web-Scraping
Millions of new blog posts are written each day. 

Thousands of tweets are set free to the world each second. 

Millions of minutes of podcasts are published every. Single. Week.

So how do you keep up with all of it?

Using AI Text Summarization  we're going to be running through how to perform long form summarization for blog posts. We'll be able to scrape a website using Beautiful Soup. Bring the text into a Python Jupyter Notebook and have a pre-trained, AI powered summarization pipeline from Hugging Face do all the summarizing for us!
